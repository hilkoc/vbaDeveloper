' Build instructions:
' 1. Open a new workbook in excel, then open the VB editor (Alt+F11)  and from the menu File->Import, import this file:
'     * src/vbaDeveloper.xlam/Build.bas
' 2. From tools references... add
'     * Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3
'     * Microsoft Scripting Runtime
' 3. Rename the project to 'vbaDeveloper'
' 4. Enable programatic access to VBA:
'       File -> Options -> Trust Center, Trust Center Settings, -> Macros,
'       tick the box: 'Enable programatic access to VBA'  (In excel 2010: 'Trust access to the vba project object model')
'       If you policy seetings don't allow to change this option you can create the following registry key:
'           [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\office\{Excel-Version}\excel\security]
'           "accessvbom"=dword:00000001
'       If you get 'path not found' exception in Excel 2013, include the following step:
'           In 'Trust Center' settings, go to 'File Block Settings' and un-check 'open' and/or 'save' 
'           for 'Excel 2007 and later Macro-Enabled Workbooks and Templates'.
' 5. If using a non-English version of Excel, rename your current workbook into ThisWorkbook (in VB Editor, press F4,
'    then under the local name for Microsoft Excel Objects, select the workbook. Set the property '(Name)' to ThisWorkbook)
' 6. In VB Editor, press F4, then under Microsoft Excel Objects, select ThisWorkbook in vbaDeveloper. Set the property 'IsAddin' to TRUE
' 7. In VB Editor, menu File-->Save Book1; Save as vbaDeveloper.xlam in the same directory as 'src'
' 8. Close excel. Open excel with a new workbook, then open the just saved vbaDeveloper.xlam
' 9. Let vbaDeveloper import its own code. Put the cursor in the function 'testImport' and press F5
' 10.Right click on 'vbaDeveloper', Import File for:
'     * CustomActions.cls
'     * EventListener.cls
'     * MyCustomActions.cls
' 11.Read the instructions in ThisWorkbook in vbaDeveloper Project and uncomment the code if you want automatic import and export enabled
' 12.If necessary rename module 'Build1' to Build. Menu File-->Save vbaDeveloper.xlam
' 13.Open the Excel workbook where you want to use vbaDeveloper and add vbaDeveloper.xlam as reference to load the Add-In with the workbook:
'       In VB Editor -> Tools -> References -> Browse and select vbaDeveloper.xlam
'       Save the workbook, close it and reopen the workbook, now in the menu ribbon the ADD-INS tab is available with the VbaDeveloper menu
